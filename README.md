# EXMR FOUNDATION NETWORK
Integrating developers for a better future in the crypto world!


A brief history of us, we started in October of 2017
with the idea of creating a private token as Monero
XMR coin, and we called Ethereum Monero (EXMR)
to our ERC20, but given the prohibitions of
governments and the attack on these types of coins
with privacy and understanding that we would have
limitations we made a different movement.
Then EXMR in mid-2018, we made an ICO but the
funds obtained at that time were not enough
since we had been dragging the name of
Ethereum Monero, but even so, we continued
by our firm conviction and the responsibility
then we started a new path, the funds were
used, in rates to be listed in the following
exchanges: Yobit, Bitebtc, Instanbitex,
Cryptaldash, and others, as well as in services
related to exchanges, were also used in the
initiation of the project with a payment
gateway, wallet vault, merchant tools, swap, & point of sales system, etc.
called EXMR GetCryptoPayments getcryptopayments.com
An ambitious and large project, the same for its magnitude and costs has
taken us time to complete, since it will include a wide range of tools,
applications, plugins, services, etc., we have as a goal to conclude this 2020.
Other funds were used to pay for some advertising, promotion, videos,
image designs, articles, media networks promotion, re-brand investment,
etc., and to keep us in the market even with the great falls of the same, even
though we manage as much as we could the lack of liquidity in terms of the
amount of tokens left in our hands, we need to rethink again and start
something more attractive for the entire crypto community since we have a
committed team and great support for our community, that is why for a few
months, we made a radical change, we created a new secure smart contract
already audited, and that has special functions such as: staking rewards,
percentages to burn tokens for transactions this optional by voting, and
other functions more. We have successfully completed our swap.
For all that we have learned in the way of the mistakes made, we are now:
EXMR FOUNDATION NETWORK (EXMR FDN)

We are a laboratory of dApps and Projects to continue promoting the crypto
world our main objective, is to integrate a large number of developers
passionate about blockchain technology, which through our foundation
finds the support to create its dApps and projects under our ecosystem and
with the help of other developers, for this we have created a program
called EXMR FDN Developer Bounty, which is open to all developers
You should only apply https://exmrfoundation.org/dev-bounty and
integrate into the development work that will begin this 2020.
EXMR FDN token has a total supply of
18 Million of which, there is already a
placement to date of 10 Million in the
market, the remaining 8 Million continues
in the IEO. We have a maximum supply of
75 Million by subtracting the 18 Million we
are left with 57 Million these are being
distributed as follows:
Developer Bounty: 25M
Team & Future Company use: 7M
Staking Reward: 25M
IEO: 18M
EXMR FDN currently provides a staking rewards system for its holders so
that they can generate 0.01% on their frozen tokens every day.
You should only purchase EXMR FDN and place them in our dApp
https://dapp.exmr.io these rewards are for keeping your tokens in a cold
wallet and strengthening our price in the exchanges, there are currently
more than 9 Million frozen of EXMR FDN.
We are receiving great support right now; we invite you to join this
movement.
Our foundation requires your support to execute all our projects and
support blockchain technology so we are in an IEO process.
